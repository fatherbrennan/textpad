# Textpad

Simple app for text transformation.

## About

Text typed or copy and pasta’d into the input field will be stripped of newlines and replaced with a single space.

> _Note: The input field is text wrapped... there are no newlines._

## Examples

`input`

```text
Michael Scott is
the world’s best boss...
his mug said so!
```

`transformed`

```text
Michael Scott is the world’s best boss... his mug said so!
```
